        <h1>Cultural Connections Page!</h1>
        <p>Hello I'm Christian Julian Salazar. Welcome to my cultural connections page!"</p>
        <img src="Photo/photobooth.jpg" alt="In middle of the nature" style="width: 100px;" height="100px">

        <p>
            Cultural shocks:One of the things that struck me when I got here is that people who live on the streets tend 
            to consume drugs that coincidentally leave them in an unharmed state without being able to move and their body 
            remains adapted to an uncomfortable position, like in the series, and this is told to me that it is a strategy that 
            the government implements so that there are no robberies or assaults towards citizens, in the end some die from overdoses, 
            something that I never expected to see this on the public street.
            On the other hand, transportation surprises me because I usually see buses full and with a flow of people, but here this service 
            being public has a high cost compared to other routes that are outside the city, respecting each stop without discrimination or fights 
            between drivers or passengers, they are even very kind and if you are in need you can ask how to get to a certain place, to any random person, (that happened to me)
            
            Things I miss: One of the things I miss is the food, because maybe it is because of the high quality standards of the products that make it a little expensive here, but I 
            do need to try at least one day the typical dish of my grandmother, like red rice or chicken stew.

            Another thing I miss is the typical store next door where you can find everything for a better price, whether it is for a
             dollar to make a lunch or buy some candy, but here, whether it is because of quality standards, the regulation of the products is not as open as in Ecuador.

            Amazing things I love:I love being here in safe conditions because despite the difficult situation that much of Latin America is going through,
             one thinks and sees how other people act, who are not only carried away by power and vice, but here they are open and free to express 
             who they are, that does not mean that I should be too confident, and whenever I go out anywhere I am always attentive and cautious.
